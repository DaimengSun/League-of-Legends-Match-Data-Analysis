## Introduction

In this project, we will investigate if there's bias in league of legends competitive games that favors one side over the other. <br><br>Specifically, we will investigate its fairness by exploring impact of getting dragon objectives on the game as claiming dragons in league of legends 2022 season provide permanent benefits that could shift the direction of the match. <br><br>Then we will investigate if both sides are equally likely to get dragon objectives to show the game's fairness.
